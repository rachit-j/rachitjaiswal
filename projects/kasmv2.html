<p>KasmV2 is a district-wide cloud computing system that enables students to access full-featured virtual machines from low-powered Chromebooks. </p>
<br>
<p>It is designed for scalability and equity, made to ensure all students in Poway USD have access to high-performance environments for computing and coursework. </p>
<br>
<p>The installer and core setup tools are publicly available on the GitHub repository: nighthawkcoders/kasm-multi-server. </p>
<br>
<p>Documentation, migration instructions, and updates to the DockerHub-based deployment are maintained on the PUSD-hosted version: open-coding-society/kasm-platform</p>
<br>
<p>KasmV2 uses the Kasm Platforms system, running on AWS and generated with the use of Ansible, Terraform, SSH, and Shell.</p>
<br>
<p>It is currently deployed and in use at the Poway Unified School District in San Diego, California. The project started deployment in 2024.</p>
