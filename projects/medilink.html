<p>MediLink is a blockchain-inspired universal electronic medical record (EMR) system designed to streamline patient data sharing across providers. </p>
<br>
<p>It creates a dynamic health profile containing verified medical records, AI-interpreted data, and patient-controlled self-reported information to improve accuracy and accessibility. </p>
<br>
<p>MediLink allows patients to securely share their profiles with providers, while its AI engine routes cases to the right specialists, suggests health improvements, and adapts to geographical or outbreak-specific needs. </p>
<br>
<p>The system emphasizes interoperability, efficiency, and universal utilization, standing apart from existing EMRs by focusing on standardization and patient empowerment. </p>
<br>
<p>MediLink was prototyped during a Big Data Hackathon, winning the second place High School Geocomputational Thinker Award.</p>
