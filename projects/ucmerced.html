<p>At UC Merced, I conducted research on the safety and reliability of large language models in safety-critical systems under Professor Ayush Pandey. </p>
<br>
<p>The work focused on identifying and mitigating hallucinations in AI outputs, with applications in areas such as healthcare diagnostics and cybersecurity. </p>
<br>
<p>I developed evaluation frameworks, tested model behavior across edge cases, and analyzed the risks of deploying AI in mission-critical environments. </p>
<br>
<p>This research highlighted the importance of precision, trustworthiness, and interpretability in advancing the safe adoption of AI technologies. </p>
