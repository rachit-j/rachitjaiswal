<p>Horizon Academic is a research mentorship program connecting high school students with university professors for advanced independent projects.</p>
<br>
<p>I conducted research in computer vision, developing an image recognition system for classifying plastic bottles.</p>
<br>
<p>The project involved training machine learning models with OpenCV to improve classification accuracy and efficiency using the WARP dataset from Kaggle.</p>
<br>
<p>My findings demonstrated significant improvements in sorting performance over random selection methods and baseline models.</p>
<br>
<p>I conducted this research in the summer with Professor Guillermo Goldstein from Georgia Institute of Technology and published my paper in the Horizon Academic Research Journal V4.2.</p>
