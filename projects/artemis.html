<p>Artemis is a gesture-controlled AI assistant built on the Raspberry Pi, designed to combine computer vision with snap-in modules like natural language interaction. </p>
<br>
<p>The system uses OpenCV to recognize hand signals, activating a voice interface that connects to GPT for intelligent command execution and conversation. </p>
<br>
<p>Artemis supports a custom command system, allowing users to open, read, and store files, run lightweight actions, and handle follow-up intent through conversational flow. </p>
<br>
<p>Developed as a personal portfolio project, Artemis demonstrates the integration of vision-based gesture recognition with AI-driven command processing. </p>
