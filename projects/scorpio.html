<p>FTC Team Scorpio is a competitive robotics team focused on designing, building, and programming high-performance robots for the FIRST Tech Challenge. </p>
<br>
<p>Our approach emphasizes innovation, collaboration, and technical excellence, combining advanced mechanical engineering with robust software development to compete at the highest levels. </p>
<br>
<p>As a Captain, I worked on the design, fabrication and programming of the robot, designing autonomous detection systems using CV and ML and odometry-based movement using PID loops and Finite State Machines.</p>
<br>
<p>The team leverages the CAD modeling, autonomous navigation algorithms, sensor integration, and vision processing with OpenCV to achieve precise, reliable performance on the field.</p>
<br>
<p>Our team has placed #18th in the world, #2 in California, and #1 in San Diego, while recieving numerous awards related from our robot design to our community outreach.</p>
