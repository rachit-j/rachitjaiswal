<p>CodeMaxxers is a collaborative computer science game developed by a team of 15 students, where I served as the SCRUM Master. </p>
<br>
<p>The project combined Java, Node.js, and Flask backends to power interactive gameplay, real-time communication, and scalable user management. </p>
<br>
<p>Key features included WebSocket-driven multiplayer interaction, recursive problem-solving mechanics, integrated user analytics, and thoughtful game design. </p>
<br>
<p>As SCRUM Master, I coordinated sprints, managed cross-functional collaboration, and ensured the delivery of a robust and engaging learning platform. </p>
