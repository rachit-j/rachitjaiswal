<p>RIFT is a cloud infrastructure management tool built to simplify the deployment, control, and monitoring of AWS EC2 instances for students and educators. </p>
<br>
<p>It integrates with Cockpit and Terraform while utilizing the AWS API, providing a streamlined interface to launch, monitor, and manage virtual machines in real time. </p>
<br>
<p>RIFT was designed as both a practical utility and a teaching resource, enabling students to learn modern cloud practices through hands-on experience. </p>
<br>
<p>It was used in PUSD to run tests and quizzes as well as to help students deploy their own websites. Over 200 students have used this site. Existing guides and blogs are still in use today. </p>
