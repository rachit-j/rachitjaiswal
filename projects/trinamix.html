<p>TrinamiX is a technology company specializing in advanced sensing solutions and material identification through innovative hardware and AI integration.</p>
<br>
<p>I contributed to computer vision and AI projects, working with laser speckle analysis to accurately identify and classify materials.</p>
<br>
<p>The work involved dataset creation, algorithm development, and testing for real-world applications in material recognition at Trinamix Headquarters in Germany.</p>
